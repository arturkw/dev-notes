## How to work well in teams
1. Hiding work is bad: increases the chances of making a mistake, increases the implementation time.
2. Myth of genius: authors of large projects are known (Linus Torvalds, Bill Gates) but it is forgotten that the real authors of their solutions are the teams they created. 
3. The "Bus Rate" determines the number of people who need to be hit by a bus before a project is completely lost. 
4. Work to get feedback as soon as possible. Early detection of problems avoids disaster at a later stage.
5. Share your vision, share the results of your work, learn from others, create a great team.
6. Get your ego under control.
7. Learn to criticize and accept criticism.
8. Get confused quickly and iterate. Getting it wrong is the price of innovation.
