## How to work well in teams
1. Hiding work is bad: increases the chances of making a mistake, increases the implementation time.
2. Myth of genius: authors of large projects are known (Linus Torvalds, Bill Gates) but it is forgotten that the real authors of their solutions are the teams they created. 
3. The "Bus Rate" determines the number of people who need to be hit by a bus before a project is completely lost. 
4. Work to get feedback as soon as possible. Early detection of problems avoids disaster at a later stage.
5. Share your vision, share the results of your work, learn from others, create a great team.
6. Get your ego under control.
7. Learn to criticize and accept criticism.
8. Get confused quickly and iterate. Getting it wrong is the price of innovation.

## Sharing Knowledge

1. The culture of learning is connected to the necessity of providing psychological safety, allowing people to admit to a lack of knowledge.
2. True experts possess knowledge about things that have not been documented.
3. Always keep learning and asking questions.
4. Before removing or modifying something, understand first why it exists.
5. There's a chance that future beginners will have the same questions you asked. Do them a favor and share what you've noted.
6. Documentation that doesn't offer sufficient searchability might as well not exist. In Google, documentation is right next to the source code, unlike being placed somewhere outside, in an elusive document or website.
7. Organizational culture is an uncertain matter involving people, something many companies treat as an add-on. In Google, there's a belief that focusing first on culture and the environment yields better results than solely concentrating on the outcome of such an environment.
8. Canonical sources of information are centralized collections of information across the entire company, providing a method for standardizing and disseminating expert knowledge.

## How to Lead a Team?

1. At Google, it was decided that managers overseeing software engineering should have an engineering background. This means either hiring experienced engineers to become managers or providing training for those already employed.
2. Above all, resist the temptation to micromanage.
3. If your employees are so disinterested in their work that they actually need a traditional manager to act as a caretaker, convincing them to do their job, it means you have a serious problem.
4. Antipatterns:
   - Hiring naive individuals: It's much easier to expand your skills when surrounded by people smarter than you.
   - Ignoring underperformers: Hoping for improvement is not a strategy. Ignoring low-performing individuals discourages high-performers from joining the team and encourages them to leave.
   - Ignoring human issues
   - Lowering the hiring bar: The cost of finding the right person (recruitment, advertising, time) is much lower than the cost of hiring the wrong person.
5. Positive patterns:
   - Let go of ego
   - Be a Zen master: Calmness is crucial, asking questions is a way to find solutions.
   - Be a catalyst
   - Remove obstacles
   - Set clear goals
   - Be honest
   - Monitor satisfaction levels
   - Delegate but work intensively
   - Look for your successor
   - Protect the team from chaos
   - Let the team know when they are doing well
   - Pay attention to focus, direction, and speed issues

## Performance Measurement
Before conducting a measurement, ask if the result could impact operations regardless of whether it's positive or negative. If you can't take any action based on the result, it probably doesn't make sense to conduct the measurement.

## Code Review

Benefits of code inspection:
- Code correctness
- Code clarity
- Code consistency
- Knowledge sharing

Best practices for code inspection:
- Be polite and professional
- Make minor changes
- Provide good descriptions of changes
- Limit the number of people conducting the code review to a minimum
- Code review improves code correctness, understanding, and consistency
- Allows for validation of one's assumptions by someone else
