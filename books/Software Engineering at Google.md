## How to work well in teams
1. Hiding work is bad: increases the chances of making a mistake, increases the implementation time.
2. Myth of genius: authors of large projects are known (Linus Torvalds, Bill Gates) but it is forgotten that the real authors of their solutions are the teams they created. 
3. The "Bus Rate" determines the number of people who need to be hit by a bus before a project is completely lost. 
4. Work to get feedback as soon as possible. Early detection of problems avoids disaster at a later stage.
5. Share your vision, share the results of your work, learn from others, create a great team.
6. Get your ego under control.
7. Learn to criticize and accept criticism.
8. Get confused quickly and iterate. Getting it wrong is the price of innovation.

## Sharing Knowledge

1. The culture of learning is connected to the necessity of providing psychological safety, allowing people to admit to a lack of knowledge.
2. True experts possess knowledge about things that have not been documented.
3. Always keep learning and asking questions.
4. Before removing or modifying something, understand first why it exists.
5. There's a chance that future beginners will have the same questions you asked. Do them a favor and share what you've noted.
6. Documentation that doesn't offer sufficient searchability might as well not exist. In Google, documentation is right next to the source code, unlike being placed somewhere outside, in an elusive document or website.
7. Organizational culture is an uncertain matter involving people, something many companies treat as an add-on. In Google, there's a belief that focusing first on culture and the environment yields better results than solely concentrating on the outcome of such an environment.
8. Canonical sources of information are centralized collections of information across the entire company, providing a method for standardizing and disseminating expert knowledge.
